### HashDB
A portable hash based database library for managing data files that contain \
text or binary key/data pairs of arbitrary sizes. A database can be up to 4GB \
in size and are safe to read and write concurrently.

HashDB is heavily inspired by the PureDB portable database library source, which \
you can find [here](https://pureftpd.sourceforge.net/puredb/).
